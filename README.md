### A Widget to Showcase new Features in your App, or created a Guided tour in your app.

The basic idea is that you add a unique class name to an element (div, h1, etc.) and then add that class name to the
widget, you give it a title and a description and that will create a guided introduction to your app. This will take the
user on a step by step journey through the App.

## Features

-   Highlight Important information or key aspect is Complex Apps.

-   As the value is stored in the Data Model, this can be dynamically turned on or off based on actions in your app.

## Reasons to Use

Currently there is another Widget available ([Guided Tour](https://appstore.home.mendix.com/link/app/115336/)) it uses
the same underling React Lib, the difference between this Widget and that is as follows:

|                                | App Guide | Guided Tour                       |
| ------------------------------ | --------- | --------------------------------- |
| Attribute Stored in Data Model | ✅        | ❌ _(Uses Local Browser Storage)_ |
| Solves Scroll Bug \*           | ✅        | ❌                                |
| Works Across Pages             | ✅        | ❌                                |

This widget also solves a Race condition when Mendix app is loading and the Widget is initializing.

_\* As most Mendix apps use a fixed window hight and scrolls a containing div, this causes issues when the desired
highlighted point is not in the Viewport on page load._

## Usage

There are Various Options Available with some caveat's:
